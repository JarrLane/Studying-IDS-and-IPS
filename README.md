# Studying-IDS-and-IPS

My name is Jarrett Lane, student at Florida Polytechnic University.

I think cyber security is a really cool subject and I want to divulge into it more. To do this I have decided to take on some personal projects including this one. This project is about learning about intrusion detection and prevention systems and how they work. In this repository I will probably keep notes here as well as maybe do some experiments with python. To you reading this, I hope you enjoy my repository.
